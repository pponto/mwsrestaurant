## Project Overview: Stage 1

Udacity Front-End Web Dev Nano-Degree Project. A responsive and accessible Web App including service worker.

### What will I learn?

I've learned to use some codes to make a website responsive. I applied some ARIA techniques in html. I learned the basics to make a site available offline through the service worker.

### What do I do from here?

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

### Solutions Implemented

- [x] Fully mobile-ready website flexbox and media queries.
- [x] Improved accessibility of the website using ARIA specifications.
- [x] Added basic service worker for caching using offline-first apporach.
